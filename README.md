# Sudoku-Solver

The purpose of this project is to solve a sudoku taken from an input image or video and superimpose the solution on the given frame. To do so the input has to be enhanced in order to effectively extract the gridâ€™s contours and corners; then, after the grid has been straightened, the numbers are read and the solution is computed. The final step consists in superimposing the solution layer to the original one, filling in the blank squares.
